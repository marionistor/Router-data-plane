C-based router data plane that uses a trie for fast next-hop lookups, handling IPv4 and ARP packets. It processes ICMP messages, validates checksums, and manages TTL while forwarding packets. The router maintains an ARP table for MAC resolution and queues packets awaiting ARP replies. It ensures efficient packet forwarding, implementing error handling for unreachable destinations and other network failures.
