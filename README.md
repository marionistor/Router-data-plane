A C project that implements a router using a trie for fast next-hop lookup, handling IPv4 and ARP packets. It processes ICMP messages, validates checksums, manages TTL, and resolves MAC addresses through an ARP table. Packets are queued when waiting for ARP replies, ensuring efficient forwarding and error handling.
